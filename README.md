# AI on Edge (IoT)
1. This is a platform for controlling the IoT devices.
2. Admins can register various types of sensors with their properties, and developers can up-load and run/schedule IOT based algorithms
on them.
3. The platform takes care of validating code,creating virtual environments, load balanc-ing,sensor binding and functionality of show-ing real time output which then can be used to take particular action.
4. Technologies used: Python, kafka, Docker,Flask, MongoDB.
