1. Sensor Registration Service :
1. Admin will upload a .json file containing information/mapping of sensor gateway with kafka topic and other sensor details.
2. Module will be responsible to parse the meta file provided by the admin containing sensor information. This service will help register the sensor details and will create a unique topic for data to be dumped for each sensor. Each sensor gateway will receive a topic for data dumping.


2. Sensor Manager :
   1. Responsible for validating whether requested sensor details are available in system or not.
   2. If available it will get its details from the registry.
   3. From the repository it will read the sensor topic over which sensor is dumping the data
   4. Further SM will send this data and appropriately will send the data to Algorithm
